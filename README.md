## üöó Car Sales Analysis ‚Äì Uncovering the Power of the Automotive Market  
Project Description
In this project, I conducted an analysis of car sales data in the United States, focusing on cities such as Aurora, Austin, Greenville, Janesville, Middletown, Pasco, and Scottsdale. The goal was to understand the dynamic changes in car sales, prices, customer preferences, and other market factors.

**üîç Analysis Findings **
1Ô∏è‚É£ Car Prices in 2023: Decrease in Average Prices, but Does This Mark the End of Growth?
The analysis revealed that the average price of cars in most cities was lower in 2023 compared to the previous year. This could suggest changes in sales strategies or the market‚Äôs response to shifting consumer needs. While prices decreased, it didn‚Äôt result in weaker sales ‚Äì quite the opposite!

2Ô∏è‚É£ Car Sales Are on the Rise!
The number of cars sold in 2023 increased by 24% compared to the previous year. Although the price decrease may have contributed to this, equally important were effective marketing strategies and a better alignment of offerings with market needs.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Men as the Main Consumers in the Automotive Market
The data shows that men make up the overwhelming majority of car buyers. This may reflect traditional consumer roles, but it could also be due to differences in interests and needs.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Transmission and Color Preferences
Surprisingly, automatic transmission cars were preferred by both genders, with men dominating in this segment. When it comes to car colors, white was the most popular choice, which could be surprising given the popularity of darker shades in other segments of the market.

üìä Interactive Features of the Dashboard
Drillthrough
Use the drillthrough feature to move to a new page with more detailed data on specific cities, companies, or car models. This allows for a deeper understanding of sales in a given region.

Drilldown
With the drilldown feature on the charts, you can explore data at the model level, analyzing their sales based on city and year. This enables a more granular exploration of detailed information.

Bookmarks
The bookmarks feature allows you to quickly switch between different views. You can, for example, view the top 20 best-selling companies or analyze data across all companies at once.

üéØ Summary
This project highlights how the automotive market in the US is evolving in response to changes in prices, consumer preferences, and effective marketing strategies. The interactive features of the dashboard allow for deeper exploration of data, supporting better business decisions by providing easy access to key insights and analyses.
